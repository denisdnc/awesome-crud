# Awesome CRUD
# An Node JS supercool REST API

The idea is to build an REST API in Node JS using best practices, patterns and frameworks that can be used in an enterprise application.

For this, it will be used the following patterns:

Architecture:
- The Clean Architecture

Java Script:
- Revealing Module Pattern

NodeJS:
- Error-First Callbacks

And the following frameworks:
- Express JS
- Mocha
- Chai

Package manager:
- npm
